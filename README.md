# Road to Mastery

Planning to jot down some random things that work for me over the years.

1. Never read in front of computer. When you read, read a paper book. Do that away from computer.
2. When you are sitting in front of computer, you are doing one thing. If I am sitting in front of computer; either I am coding, googling or online shopping.
3. Stick with a few tools and master them. Choose one IDE and memorize most of useful shortcut keys.
4. Touch typing matter. You should be automatically using "correct" side of <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> <kbd>ALT</kbd> when you type.
5. It's absolutely OK to google up code snippets, but try to make it yours by understanding them and memorizing them. Try not to look up a same thing twice.
6. If you don't have anything in your head, how smart are you? Memorization matters. It is the beginning of EVERYTHING. Try "The Memory Book."
7. Never use Beta version of anything. You don't want to waste your time managing other people's problems and by using beta (e.g. Windows 10 Insider Program) you are doing exactly that. Stick with LTS (long term support) versions.
